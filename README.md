# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is based on the idea shared on this webpage https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-an-infinite-scrolling-list-of-pokemons/

I added 2 custom hooks: 
- One for handling the fetch request to Pokemon API
- One for handling the events related to Intersection Observer API

If you wan to check the code, just run

```js
npm install

npm run dev
```
